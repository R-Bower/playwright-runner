      "New plant parents can get a confident start with this bundle of three hard-to-kill green babies. Golden pothos is sometimes called devil's ivy because they are so hard to kill. They have gorgeous trailing leaves and look great in a hanging planter. The ZZ plant can also handle low levels of water and light. Finally, the money tree is an easy-care plant that's rumored to bring good luck and fortune."
