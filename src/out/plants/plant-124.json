      "This air plant goes through color change at bloom time like a mood ring! The green-olive leaves sprout from the center and deepen to a sun-kissed red when in bloom. The soft-leaved species mimicking velvet is due to the number of trichomes. Trichomes guard against chemical and microbial organisms like aphids. They also absorb water, airborne minerals and regulate water loss by transpiration. The bottom of the stem where the roots are is brown and may fool some as being root rot.",
      "When blooming, the bracts show off a bright red. The Velutina flowers from the inflorescence consist of several small shoots; each will display only a couple of flowers, making the overall look rounded."
