      "Add a touch of the tropics with this broad-leafed, gorgeous banana tree. Versatile as can be, this patio plant does just as well in a pot or planted in-ground, but make sure they have excellent drainage. Though a dwarf varietal, they can grow upwards of 6 feet tall and will produce fruit once per tree. They will fruit in 2-3 years"
