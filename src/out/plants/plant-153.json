      "The New Zealand flax (Phormium tenax) tropical-looking, easy-care plant features long colorful sword-like leaves to emerge from a clump. Multicolored foliage of dark red, green, golden, purple, and burgundy make this an eye-catching display. Their grass-like texture makes them a perfect plant for planting in a mass on a bank or as a filler in a contemporary setting."
