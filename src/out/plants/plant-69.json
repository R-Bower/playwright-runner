      "They are A VIBE!",
      "Bring the rainforest home with our tropical collection for delivery. Featuring four plants, they are the perfect way to begin your indoor jungle. The selection includes golden pothos, which is a super easy-to-care-for ivy with lovely trailing leaves. There's also a peacock plant, famous for its striking foliage that's red underneath and variegated shades of green on top â€” just like a watermelon. Finally, there's a flamingo flower with bright pink blooms."
