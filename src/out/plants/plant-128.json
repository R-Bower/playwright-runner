      "Tillandsia Victoria is on our top ten list, and she'll be on yours too. She struts blushing tints of red on her leaves with purple flowers when they get bright, indirect light during the blooming phase. Victoria also generates offsets soon after blooming for propagation! Victoria is the favorite you'll want in your collection.",
      "She is a simple, easy-care plant. Dunk in filtered or rainwater (unsoftened) at least once a week and mist several times between watering. Let it drain upside down to prevent watering from getting trapped amongst the leaves and causing rot."
