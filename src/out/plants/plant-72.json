      "Alocasia macrorrhizos, commonly called Upright Elephant Ear, is a lush, tropical perennial prized for their giant ornamentally decorative leaves resembling an elephant's ears. Their skyward reaching leaves distinguish them from the colocasia, which droop downward. Their thick, heart-shaped leaves and green, wavy edges grow 3-6 feet long and up to 4 feet wide on rigid stalks. They can reach 6-15 feet in height in premium growing conditions."
