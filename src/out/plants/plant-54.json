      "Alocasia macrorrhizos, commonly called Upright Elephant Ear, is a lush, tropical perennial prized for its giant ornamentally decorative leaves resembling an elephant's ears.  Its skyward reaching leaves distinguish it from the colocasia, which droop downward. Their thick, heart-shaped leaves and green, wavy edges grow 3-6 feet long and up to 4 feet wide on rigid stalks. They can reach 6-15 feet in height in premium growing conditions.",
      "Its large corm root system, where the foliage emerges, grows just below the earth's surface and develops into rhizomes and tubers. This plant prefers wetter soil and can tolerate standing water, making it a superb rain gardening plant specimen. Its lush arrowhead-shaped leaves can grow as wide as 60 inches.",
