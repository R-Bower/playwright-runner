      "The Ionantha Fuego is a small air plant with fuzzy green leaves. When they bloom, they will transform into tones of red to contrast with their purple flowers. These plants are great for terrariums, crafts, and displays on shelves. After blooming, the plant will produce offsets to duplicate the parent plant as they slowly die. This process is a recycling process the air plant goes through to keep growing new plants! Add to a bright, indirect place, water regularly, and keep humidity high. Enjoy the ebb and flow of this plant for generations!"
