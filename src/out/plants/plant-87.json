      "Hearty, deep sea-green leaves topped with flowers that come in a range of colors. This bundle includes 4 small (4\" pot diameter) African Violet plants. Colors will vary based on availability.",
      "African Violets (Saintpaulia species) are super easy to care for and offer abundant flowers. Place them near a north or east-facing window that receives ample indirect light; keep them warm (between 65-80 degrees Fahrenheit) with 8 hours of darkness each night, and provide ample humidity.",
      "*Our blooms vary and may not arrive as they are pictured. We ship our plants still in buds, so you can enjoy a fresh bloom in your home.*"
