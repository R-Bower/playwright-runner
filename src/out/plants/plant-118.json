      "This plant will ship with a yellow or red bloom - growers' choice (we pick the healthiest, happiest plant!)",
      "The flowers on the Hibiscus (Hibiscus rosa-sinensis) announce their debut with the trumpet-shaped flowers that embellish the green foliage of this shrub. In warm temperature zones, they can reach 10-12' tall when grown outdoors. Treat them as an annual in cooler sections of the country or bring them inside as a houseplant to overwinter. However, a few buds may drop with a change in lighting and temps, so do it gradually to help them adapt to their new environment. Their blooms are dynamic in color and can be a whopping 4-8\" in diameter to wrap your space in a tropical vibe!"
