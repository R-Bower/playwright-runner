      "The T.butzii has a ballerina-like look as if the spotted dark and light green leaves were raising for a pirouette on their bulbous base. Butzii can reach 8-10 inches long and produce a show-stopping red inflorescence with bright purple flowers. Don't miss watering and misting this one. Ensure they dry properly by shaking any excess water from the bulbous area and provide good air circulation"
