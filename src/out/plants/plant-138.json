      "Silver Queen gets their name because the leaves have a slight grayish-white fuzz coating them, forming a rosette with pointed leaves. They will be \"queen bee\" amongst the other tillies when they bloom on the tall bract from the center stalk. They will require bright, indirect light and, like some tillyâ€™s, want to be watered at least twice a week and well-drained afterward."
