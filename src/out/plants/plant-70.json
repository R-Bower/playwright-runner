      "Tuberous Begonias (Begonia Tuberosa) feature vivid flower petals ranging in white, yellow, apricot, pink, rose, and red. The colorful blossoms have a backdrop of serrated green leaves, although they get hidden often by the 6-inch proliferous blooms. This plant grows 12-18 inches tall in the garden's shady areas or bright, indirect light on a covered porch or indoor table.",
      "*We will ship a yellow, peach, or red plant --- we will choose the happiest and healthiest available for you!",
      "*Our blooms vary and may not arrive as they are pictured. We ship our plants still in buds, so you can enjoy a fresh bloom in your home.*"
