      "The Cordyline Red Sensation's dark stripes of pink to red burgundy leaves a grassy tropical look. This indoor plant is notably tough and therefore requires very little maintenance. The exotic colored palm tree-like growth makes a great focal point in the landscape or containers. Bring inside and enjoy its color up close in a brightly lit room for an accessory piece."
