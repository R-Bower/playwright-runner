      "This dramatic spiky rosette-shaped Tilly has various shades of bright green and red on the tips of the leaves. As they begin the bloom cycle, the leaves transition into light pink to red hues giving the signal bloom time is near. For your patience, an iconic purple spike with yellow flowers appears to contrast with the multicolors of this perfect creation. Keep them in moderate to bright, indirect light, and water weekly. Display this cutie on driftwood, ceramic planters, tabletops, and terrariums."
