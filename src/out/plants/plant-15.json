      "A popular houseplant for more than three hundred years, the lady palm (Rhapis Excelsa) instantly brings elegance into any room. They are one of our indoor and outdoor plants â€” they can grow happily on your patio if you live in USDA hardiness zones 8b through 12. They grow from multiple stems and have fan-shaped fronds, which give them a truly unique look. Not only are they beautiful, but they are also low maintenance too."
