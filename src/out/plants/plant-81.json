      "This wreath is hand-made and can be either hung or used as a table centerpiece. We start with a grapevine wreath and add moss and quality succulent rosettes that are grown in Southern California.",
      "Easy maintenance, just keep them in lots of bright sunlight, avoiding harsh direct noon rays in summer. Drench with water every week or when moss is very dry.Succulent plants have a beautiful floral shape but are actually living plants! They'll grow and thrive with little care and surprise you with a showy display of colorful, long-lasting blooms.",
