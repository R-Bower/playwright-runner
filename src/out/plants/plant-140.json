      "As the botanical name implies, this Tillandsia is a combo of both Steptophylla and Brachycaulos that ends up growing more prominent than the standard forms of both. The leaves start to curl as the leaves grow longer, making them look like the ribbon in rhythmic gymnastics! The leaves will ripen to shades of pink and red as their short florescent purple flowers emerge. Dunk this one once a week and drain well. They also like a long soak monthly to rehydrate their leaves for up to 4 hours."
