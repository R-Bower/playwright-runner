      "The Trachelospermum jasminoides or Star Jasmine gets these wonderfully scented, white, star-like flowers growing on an evergreen vine. In early to late spring, the flowers bloom with residual blooms throughout the summer. Observe their fast growth up to 6 feet in a single season! Use on a porch rail, trellis, arbor, or as a privacy screen. They make a lush ground cover too.",
      "May ship with or without flowers or buds - normally blooms in May and June."
