      "Crimson Red Miniature Rose (Rosa chinensis minima) has a delicate fragrance and blooms in flushes during the growing season. The bloom size is about 1 1/2 inches wide with pink to red petals derivative of a kiss blown in the wind from Cupid. She will put on a love feast for all the pollinators between late April and September, so get your cameras ready! The green foliage makes a nice collar effect to the double-flowered cultivar we call Rosie! Expect her to top out at 12-18 inches tall.",
      "*Our blooms vary and may not arrive as they are pictured. We ship our plants still in buds, so you can enjoy a fresh bloom in your home.*"
