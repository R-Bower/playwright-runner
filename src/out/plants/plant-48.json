      "Observe the Bird's Nest Fern (Asplenium Nidus AGM) fronds as they remind us of a ruffled skirt. This epiphytic tropical, with their lush, leathery leaves, makes a stunning centerpiece. When the new fronds emerge, they resemble bird eggs, hence, their name. At maturity, these will reach 4 feet in length in the right conditions."
